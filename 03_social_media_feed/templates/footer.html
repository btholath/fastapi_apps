<!--
Below is a breakdown of each attribute and its purpose in the provided script tag:

src:
Specifies the URL of the external JavaScript file to load. In this case, it points to the minified Bootstrap bundle (which includes all of Bootstrap’s JavaScript components) hosted on the jsDelivr CDN.

integrity:
Implements Subresource Integrity (SRI). This attribute contains a cryptographic hash (using SHA-384 here) of the file’s contents. When the browser fetches the file, it computes its own hash and compares it to this value. If the hashes don’t match, the browser will refuse to load the file, protecting your site from potential tampering or malicious modifications.

crossorigin:
Indicates how the browser should handle cross-origin requests for the script. The value "anonymous" means that the request is made without sending any credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication) to the CDN. This setting is important for SRI to work correctly when fetching resources from a different origin.

</body> and </html>:
These are standard HTML closing tags. The </body> tag ends the document body, and the </html> tag ends the HTML document.

This configuration ensures that your site loads the Bootstrap JavaScript securely and efficiently from an external source.
